# Product Marketing Context — Ever Club

*Last updated: February 13, 2026*

---

## Product Overview

**One-liner:** Ever Club is a private indoor golf social club offering extended-hours access, Trackman simulators, and a high-end member lounge for driven professionals.

**What it does:** Ever Club provides a sophisticated "Third Space" that bridges the gap between a high-end workspace and a private social club. Members can host a pitch meeting, finish a slide deck, and play a round of golf — all without shifting modes. It combines premium Trackman simulator technology with a refined lounge environment designed for productivity, networking, and performance improvement.

**Product category:** Private Social Club / Indoor Golf Club / Premium Co-Working + Recreation

**Product type:** Membership-based service (tiered)

**Business model:** Recurring monthly membership with tiered access (Resident and Social tiers), plus corporate memberships, day passes, and guest policies. Transitioning brand from "Even House" to "Ever Club" to signal a more timeless, always-on community.

## Target Audience

**Target member:** The "Modern Professional" — entrepreneurs, executives, and high-performing individuals who work flexibly and need a place that looks better than a home office and is more functional than a coffee shop.

**Demographics:** 30–50 years old, high discretionary income, values "quiet luxury." Likely already members of other boutique fitness or social clubs but felt the "golf" component was missing from their lifestyle.

**Primary use case:** A place to "drop in" between meetings — to be productive and social simultaneously, with the added benefit of world-class golf simulation technology.

**Jobs to be done:**
- The "Productivity" Job: "Help me practice efficiently in 45 minutes so I don't have to spend 5 hours at a slow course."
- The "Status/Access" Job: "Give me a deeply impressive 'third place' where I can host clients or friends that feels exclusive but not stuffy."
- The "Mastery" Job: "Give me the data and technology I need to actually get better, not just guess."
- The "Sanctuary" Job: "Give me a mental break from work/home where I can focus entirely on one thing."

**Use cases:**
- Pre-work or post-work practice session with Trackman data
- Hosting a client or prospect in an impressive, private setting
- Working from the lounge between meetings
- Attending curated community and networking events
- Corporate team-building and "mental decompression" for executive teams

## Personas

| Persona | Cares about | Challenge | Value we promise |
|---------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| **The Resident** (Primary Office User) | Using the space as their primary "office" and social hub. Ownership of the experience. | Needs a space that supports both deep work and recreation without compromise. Home office is isolating; coffee shops are distracting. | "This is your office and your gym for your game. Uninterrupted focus, every day." |
| **The Social** (Community-First Member) | The club environment, community events, and networking. Has a primary office elsewhere. | Wants access to a premium golf and social experience but doesn't need a full-time workspace. | "Access to the network, the events, and the best tech — on your schedule." |
| **The Corporate Buyer** (B2B Decision Maker) | ROI on client entertainment and team perks. | Spending $500+ on individual client dinners with no recurring value. Needs a "sales tool" venue. | "A recurring venue to close deals and a wellness benefit for your executive team." |

## Problems & Pain Points

**Core problem:** High-performing professionals lack a single venue that combines productive workspace, premium golf technology, and a curated social environment — without the pretension, cost, or commitment of a traditional country club.

**Why alternatives fall short:**
- **Outdoor courses/ranges:** Weather-dependent, crowded, slow (5+ hours for a round), no work amenities
- **Home simulators:** Isolating, expensive to build ($20k+), take up too much space, lack social energy
- **Traditional country clubs:** Too expensive (initiation fees), pretentious, require long commitments, outdated atmosphere
- **TopGolf / entertainment venues:** Party atmosphere, no data-driven improvement, not conducive to business or focus
- **Five Iron / practice-only facilities:** Transactional, no community, no workspace, no "club" feeling
- **Executive suites / co-working:** No recreation, no social differentiation

**What it costs them:** Time wasted commuting to courses, missed practice due to weather or scheduling, inability to combine work and play, social isolation in home setups.

**Emotional tension:** The feeling of not having a "place" that truly fits their lifestyle — somewhere that understands they want to be productive AND unwind, without choosing one or the other.

---

## Competitive Landscape

**Direct competitors:**
- **Local indoor golf sim rooms** — Fall short because they're transactional (rent-by-the-hour), lack community, no lounge or work amenities. They sell "hitting time," not a lifestyle.

**Secondary competitors:**
- **TopGolf / Drive Shack** — Different solution (entertainment-first). Falls short because the atmosphere is loud, party-oriented, and not suited for serious practice, client meetings, or focused work.
- **Five Iron Golf** — Practice-focused but lacks the "private club" energy, curated community, and workspace integration.

**Indirect competitors:**
- **Traditional country clubs** — Conflicting approach. Far more expensive, require long-term commitments, and often feel outdated or exclusionary.
- **Executive suites / premium co-working (WeWork, Industrious)** — Compete for the "third place" need but offer zero recreation or social differentiation.
- **Home simulator setups** — Compete on convenience but lose on community, social energy, and total cost of ownership.

---

## Differentiation

**Key differentiators:**
- **The "Third Space" concept:** The only venue combining premium workspace + Trackman golf technology + curated social club in one high-design setting
- **The "Soho" element:** Members aren't buying hitting time — they're buying access to a refined atmosphere and a community of like-minded professionals who value aesthetics as much as their handicap
- **24/7 access:** Fits the schedule of busy professionals (open late — 8pm weekdays, 10pm weekends, with extended hours)
- **Tech-forward:** Best-in-class Trackman simulators that members can't justify buying for home
- **Curated community:** Like-minded, driven individuals — not a random public crowd

**How we do it differently:** We designed the entire experience around the Modern Professional's day — not around "tee times." You can work in the lounge, take a meeting in a private setting, step into a sim for 45 minutes of focused practice with real data, and never shift modes.

**Why that's better:** No other venue respects both your time and your ambition simultaneously. Country clubs demand your whole day. Sim rooms give you a box. Co-working gives you a desk. Ever Club gives you all three in one elevated environment.

**Why members choose us:** "It's the only place where I can be productive, improve my game, and host clients — all in the same visit."

## Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Is it just a simulator room?" | Golf is the centerpiece, but the club is the product. You're joining a private social and professional space — the simulators are one part of a much larger experience. |
| "Will I actually use it enough to justify the monthly cost?" | Most members come 3-4x per week because the space serves multiple purposes — work, practice, networking. It replaces your co-working, your range time, and your client entertainment budget. |
| "Is the vibe too 'bro-y' or intimidating?" | We curate our membership specifically to avoid that. The atmosphere is elevated and welcoming — think "private club," not "sports bar." |
| "What if I can't get a booking slot when I want one?" | We cap membership to ensure availability. That's why joining sooner matters — once a tier fills, the waitlist opens. |
| "I already have a setup at home / belong to a course." | Home setups are isolating and lack the social energy. Courses eat 5 hours for one round. Ever Club gives you a focused 45-minute session with better data, plus a community you actually want to be around. |

**Anti-persona (who is NOT a fit):**
- **The "Entertainment Seeker":** People looking for a TopGolf party atmosphere with loud music and bachelor parties.
- **The "Penny Pincher":** Someone who breaks down cost-per-hour and compares it to a municipal driving range.
- **The "Casual Drop-in":** Someone who doesn't respect the equipment or the focus of other members.

## Pricing Strategy Notes

**Value framing:**
- For Residents: The value is **Ownership**. "This is your office and your gym for your game."
- For Socials: The value is **Connection**. "Access to the network and the events."
- Don't sell "hours of sim time." Sell "Uninterrupted Focus" and "Frictionless Improvement."

**Price anchoring:**
- Compare to a Country Club Initiation Fee (vastly higher) or a Home Simulator Build-out ($20k+)
- NOT to Netflix or a gym membership
- "Ever Club costs less than a single bad round of golf per month, but guarantees you perfect conditions every single day."

**Corporate positioning:**
- "Client Retainer" Package: Instead of spending $500 on one dinner, a corporate membership provides a recurring venue to close deals.
- "Team Culture" Perk: A wellness and mental decompression benefit for executive teams.

**Exclusivity lever:**
- Position membership not as "buying access" but as "securing a seat."
- "We cap membership to ensure booking availability. Once the Resident tier is full, the waitlist opens. Joining now protects your access before the door closes."
